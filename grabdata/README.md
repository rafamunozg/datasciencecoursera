##Description of the functionality

The code included in this branch reads from the data provided. The information has to be available as described in the script itself:

# The script assumes the input file is already located within the Working Directory
# The .zip file was downloaded and unzipped under the /data folder

Once the code is available, you just need to source it and it'll execute the transformations needed.
